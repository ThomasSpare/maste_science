## MÅSTE - Research in Nuclear Recycling

This site is a University funded research project to help in researching how 
to develop new technologies with the aim to investigate the use of Nuclear power in a more stable, safe, cost effective, environmentally friendly way
in a longterm perspective.


### What is Nuclear Recycling ?
-----------------
Nuclear recycling, also known as nuclear fuel reprocessing, involves reusing spent nuclear fuel to extract valuable materials and reduce waste. Here’s a brief overview:

Purpose: The main goal is to recover usable materials like uranium and plutonium from spent nuclear fuel, which can then be used to produce new fuel.

### Process:
Initial Use: In a nuclear reactor, only about 5% of the uranium in a fuel rod is used for energy production. The rest remains in the spent fuel.

Reprocessing: The spent fuel is chemically treated to separate the usable materials from the waste. Techniques like PUREX (Plutonium Uranium Redox EXtraction) and pyroprocessing are commonly used.

Recycling: The recovered materials are then fabricated into new fuel, such as mixed oxide (MOX) fuel, which can be used in reactors.
### Benefits:
Energy Efficiency: Recycling can significantly increase the amount of energy extracted from the original uranium, potentially providing hundreds of years of energy from already mined uranium.

Waste Reduction: It reduces the volume of high-level radioactive waste that needs to be stored, by up to 80%1.

### Challenges:

Safety and Security: There are concerns about the potential for proliferation of nuclear weapons materials, 
as some reprocessing methods can produce weapons-grade plutonium.<br>
Economic Viability: The process can be expensive and requires advanced technology and infrastructure.<br>
Overall, nuclear recycling offers a way to make nuclear energy more sustainable and efficient, while also addressing some of the challenges associated with nuclear waste management.
