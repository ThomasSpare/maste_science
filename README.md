## MÅSTE - Multidisciplinary Commitments for Sweden's Gene IV Technology and Expertise

[LIVE SITE](https://maste-science-frontend.onrender.com/)

The project Multidisciplinära Åtaganden för Sveriges gen-IV Teknologi och Expertis (Multidisciplinary Commitments for Sweden's Gene IV Technology and Expertise), MÅSTE, lays the foundation for real understanding of the knowledge and challenges for the implementation of a Gen IV electricity production system.

It also works as a ground for increasing the base line of younger scientist and professionals in the radiation science sector bringing a huge benefit for Sweden. MÅSTE not only brings the ability to continue the existing nuclear fleet but it is also the corner stone for any new build power system and replies to other needs such as radiological awareness, protection and hospital capabilities.

MÅSTE promotes the younger research leaders and, in this way, contributes to sustainability of the high academic level at the Swedish universities where many senior researchers will retire in the next 1-2 decades.

## The Måste Projects Objective

The overall objective of the MÅSTE project is to ensure safe, secure and sustainable operation of nuclear power in the foreseeable future. To reach the objective, not only a potential technology shift to the so-called Gen IV systems is needed but also to secure competence within all disciplines concerned.

That is why MÅSTE applies the holistic approach to nuclear power operation with a focus on Gen IV technology which has a large attraction of students and younger researchers and, thus, enhance the competence base in Sweden.

The project delivers particular basis to perform an assessment of setting up a Gen IV recycling pilot in Sweden using all the areas needed including, in addition to the classical technical subjects, also radiation protection and safeguards. Another ambition of the project is to gather scattered effort in the field and join forces with other national but also international players.
